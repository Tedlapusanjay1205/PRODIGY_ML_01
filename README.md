🏠 House Price Prediction
This repository contains a Machine Learning project that predicts house prices based on various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and more. The project demonstrates end-to-end data analysis, model building, evaluation, and deployment for a regression problem in the real estate domain.

✨ Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and statistical analysis to understand key factors influencing house prices.
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, outliers, and categorical data encoding.
Model Building: Implementation of multiple regression models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting to compare performances.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tuning models using techniques like Grid Search and Random Search.
Deployment Ready: A web interface (using Flask/Streamlit) for making predictions on new data.
🚀 Tech Stack
Languages: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, XGBoost
Deployment: Flask/Streamlit (if applicable)
Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Git, VS Code

📊 Workflow
Data Analysis:

Understand dataset features and visualize relationships.
Identify and handle missing data.
Feature Engineering:

Normalize/standardize data for consistent scaling.
Encode categorical variables.
Model Training:

Build regression models and evaluate metrics like R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Model Selection:

Select the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.
Deployment:

Create an intuitive web interface for users to predict house prices.
📈 Results
Achieved an R-squared score of XX with the best model.
Model Insights: Highlight the most significant features affecting house prices.
